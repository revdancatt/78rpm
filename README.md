## About

This project was part MNML Series One (minimal series one). I'd just finished a couple of big projects and wanted to do something chill. I'd been listening to a lot of music; Orbital, Tubeway Army, The KLF, Future Sounds of London, Aphex Twin and Kate Bush. And decided to make some minimalist related projects that I could release over five days.

The first piece was inspired by John Cage's 4'33", the final piece was a fun animated thing. The three in the middle were based on records, 45rpm, 33.333rpm and 78rpm. But like the other two record projects, the maths behind 78rpm created groove patterns in the record that reflected BPM, much as you'd see the pattern in a real record.

Unlike 45rpm that could sometimes have double tracks on, or 33.333rpm that had multiple tracks with different bmps on, 78rpm only has a single track on.
